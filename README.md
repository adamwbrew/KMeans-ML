# KMeans-ML

## General Instructions

1. Import the raw data set into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Follow the steps in the lesson to prepare the data set for K-means clustering.
4. Create a model for each value of K from 2 through 5, inclusive. Create a scatterplot for each model, using color to distinguish between clusters.
3. Create additional models for K=6 through K=9, inclusive. Then generate a scree plot for all 8 models you've created. (Hint: use the .inertia_ attribute of your K-means instance as your vertical axis values.) Judging from the scree plot, what appears to be a reasonable choice of K for this data set?
